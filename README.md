MY VERSION:
-A flattened 2D version of the game, complete with upgrade paths & combinations + a select few heroes to choose from.
-A special level to choose from where you get to fight one of the boss bloons and its unique abilities.
-Specialist level difficulties which only allow you to use certain types of towers. (e.g.: Support tower, primitive tower, military tower. etc...)
